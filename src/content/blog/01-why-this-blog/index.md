For many days I have thought about starting a blog, but I couldn't get to it because of some hindrances I had in my own thoughts. That's why I am starting this blog now.

## Why I used a Astro Theme?

I know that it goes against the norm to not make this from scratch (like completely from scratch).
At the moment, i needed a place where I can put my thoughts and ideas and even technical blogs. And spending too much time on making one from scratch would have taken too much and would not be efficient for the end goal that I had set.

> Still I will start making a blog from scratch (it's not the hardest thing, yet I want to build it in a way so that I can understand most of the concepts that are important in creating websites.)

## About this blog?
Here I will be posting technical content, philosophical thoughts, what I am reading?, my observations through my experiences, case studies and also my learnings.

### I look forward to sharing this blog with everyone 😃
